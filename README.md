## Overview

This project was created as part of the **Baza Trainee Ukraine** initiative ([baza-trainee.tech](https://baza-trainee.tech/uk)), an organization that helps aspiring developers take their first professional steps in IT by working on real social and internal projects.

The website is an **animated representation** of the organization's activities. Its primary goal is to showcase Baza Trainee's mission through visually engaging and interactive elements while providing the project team with hands-on experience in animation and modern web technologies.

This project has become a significant milestone for the team, allowing participants to deepen their knowledge of animated interfaces, explore new tools, and contribute to the growth of a community for aspiring developers.

## Features

The project stands out for its highly **animated** and **interactive** user experience, making every element of the website visually engaging — even the **404 page** is uniquely designed with animations.

### Key Features:

- **Smooth Animations**:  
  Every page and component features seamless animations to enhance interactivity and visual appeal.
- **Interactive Elements**:  
  Various elements across the site respond to user interactions, creating an immersive browsing experience.
